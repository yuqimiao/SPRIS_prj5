# Outline

* Vaccine efficacy protocol
* Adverse effect analysis for Vaccine v.s. Control
* Survival analysis COVID contraction after vaccine shot

# Backgroud

* Coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had devastating consequences globally. 

* Control measures, such as the use of masks, have been variably implemented and have proved insufficient in impeding the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. 

* Vaccines are urgently needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with Covid-19. 

# Vaccine efficacy protocol

* A pharmaceutical company therefore would like to conduct a phase III randomized (**1-to-1 ratio**), **stratified**, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial at **100 U.S. sites** to demonstrate the efficacy for their developing vaccine. 

## Define primary outcome

$$
    VE = 1-\frac{p_1}{p_2}
$$

* $p_i$ : the number of new cases during 12 months over the total number at risk during 12 months in group i
* $x_i$ cases in group i with $n_i$ samples

* Goal: test the null hypothesis that the vaccine efficacy is 30% or less and provide 80% power to detect a 60% vaccine efficacy without planned interim analyses

# Vaccine efficacy protocol -- randomization procedure

* The study consists of **2 periods** :
  * Vaccine period for 2 injections
  * Follow up period: 
    * Second injection - 14 days: if the subjects have symptoms/being positive at this period, regard as not at risk and will not contribute to the efficacy calculation
    * 12 months: follow up period,
    
# Vaccine efficacy protocol -- randomization procedure

* Collect study subjects with seronegative at baseline $N_0$
* Take 2 covid shots 
* Collect status at day 14 after second shot
* Remove those becoming positive during the 14 days
* Count new cases during 12 months

# Vaccine efficacy protocol -- randomization procedure

* Blinding and Randomization procedure
  * The Phase III clinical trial will be conducted in multicenter, randomized, stratified, observer-blinded, and placebo-controlled design
  * There are 100 participating centers in the US
  * Eligible participants are those aged 16 years or older who tested seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at the recruitment time
  * We stratify the participants by age and gender, and randomly assigned persons in each stratification in a 1:1 ratio to receive either two doses of vaccines or placebo
  * They will be monitored for 12 months by active surveillance of COVID-19.
  * The trial is observer-blinded to avoid introducing bias, i.e, the participants and those responsible for the evaluation are blinded to the treatment group

# Vaccine efficacy protocol -- analysis approach

* $H_0:VE\leq30\%, H_1: VE>30\%$
* Test stat: 

\[
    Z = \frac{\phi_0 \widehat{p}_2 - \widehat{p}_1}{\sqrt{\frac{\widetilde{p}_1(1-\widetilde{p}_1)}{n_1} + \phi_0^2 \frac{\widetilde{p}_2(1-\widetilde{p}_2)}{n_2}}},
\]

where $\phi_0 = 1 - \mathrm{VE}_0, \widehat{p}_1 = \frac{x_1}{n_1},\widehat{p}_2 = \frac{x_2}{n_2},$
and $\widetilde{p}_1$ and $\widetilde{p}_2$ are the maximum likelihood estimates under the null hypothesis, calculated by
\[
    \widetilde{p}_1 = \phi_0 \widetilde{p}_2,
    \qquad 
    \widetilde{p}_2 = \frac{-B - \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A},
\]
where
\[
    A = (n_1+n_2) \phi_0,
    \qquad 
    B = -(n_1 \phi_0 + x_1 + n_2 + x_2 \phi_0),
    \qquad 
    C = x_1 + x_2,
\]
and we reject the null hypothesis if $Z > Z_\alpha$, the upper $\alpha$-th percentile of a standard normal distribution.

# Vaccine efficacy protocol -- sample size calculation
To detect a vaccine efficacy of $\mathrm{VE}_1 = 0.6$ (or vaccine event probability of $p_{1} = 0.4 p_2$) with $1 - \beta = 80\%$ power, we assume that $n_1 = n_2$, and the number of subjects needed will be determined by the following formula:

* A pharmaceutical company therefore would like to conduct a phase III randomized (**1-to-1 ratio**), **stratified**, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial is designed with sample size calculation changing missing rate and control prevalence.

* No siginificant difference between odds of having SAE in the vaccine group and control group at any of the three assessment time points. 

* The survival rate didn't drop to 50% at the end of the study. No interpretable estimation of mean and median survival time.
